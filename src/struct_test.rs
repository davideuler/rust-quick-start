//One difference between Rust and C++ is that data and behaviour are much more strictly separated in Rust than C++ (or Java, or other OO languages).
// Behaviour is defined by functions and those can be defined in traits and impls (implementations), 
// but traits cannot contain data, they are similar to Java's interfaces in that respect.
